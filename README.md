xkcd-wiki-pwgen
===============

A password generator like in http://xkcd.com/936/ based on random words from a random Wikipedia article. This way it's possible to have more uncommon words than from a dictonary and you could choose wikipedia sites in different languages, because I think remembering word in your mother tongue is easier.
