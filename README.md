xkcd-wiki-pwgen
===============

This is another password generator inspired by http://xkcd.com/936/, but based on random words from a random Wikipedia article. 
There exist already some webpages implementing a similar algorithm, but they use only English words and presumably use any kind of dictionary. 
However, by using Wikipedia as word source, it's possible to have more uncommon words than from a dictonary and you can also choose Wikipedia sites in different languages. As indicated by the comic, remembering words in your mother tongue is easier than a bunch random characters.
The generator also includes the password strength meter [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn).
