xkcd-wiki-pwgen
===============

A password generator like in http://xkcd.com/936/ based on random words from a random Wikipedia article. 
There are already existing some webpages implementing this, but only in english and presumably using any kind of dictionary. 
But by using Wikipedia as word source, it's possible to have more uncommon words than from a dictonary and you could choose Wikipedia sites in different languages, because I think remembering words in your mother tongue is easier.

To view the password generator follow this link:

TODO:
- wikipedia site selection
- fix word separation for some cases (I think issue is caused by tables)
